With the storm behind us, we can rest easy knowing that our disaster recovery plan worked like a charm. The combination of multi-region Cloud SQL replicas, multi-region Cloud Storage, and global load balancing kept things running smoothly with minimal downtime. And with Pub/Sub alerts to keep everyone in the loop, the team was never out of touch.

The cloud may have thrown a curveball our way, but we hit it out of the park. ⚾ Business continuity was never in doubt, and we were back to normal faster than you could say “cloud failover.”
